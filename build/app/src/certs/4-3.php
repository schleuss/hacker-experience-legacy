<?php echo _('In face of the recent rise of cyber crimes, the FBI started tracking more and more hackers and also launched a new service, the Safenet.'); ?>
<br/>
<br/>
<?php echo _('Both the FBI and the Safenet tracks the Internet looking for suspicious and illegal activities.'); ?><br/>
<?php echo _('These include DDoS attacks, illegal money transfers, server hacking and the installation of viruses.'); ?>
<br/>
<br/>
<?php echo _('The Safenet, however, tracks first-time criminals and small offenses.'); ?> <br/>
<?php echo _('The criminal IP address is partially listed on their site, and if an attack happens again, he/she is "promoted" to the FBI system.'); ?>
<br/>
<br/>
<?php echo _('On the FBI system, the offender\'s IP address is publicly listed and a reward is offered.'); ?><br/>
<?php echo _('It\'s not a good idea to be caught by the FBI because many people will try to attack you to get the reward.'); ?><br/>
<?php echo _('(In order to earn the reward, someone must DDoS and seize the criminal server).'); ?>
<br/>
<br/>
<?php echo _('Ah, and look out! Very powerful attacks can get you straight to the FBI system.'); ?><br/>
<?php echo _('Attacking wanted FBI criminals is a nice (but dangerous) way to earn some cash.'); ?>
