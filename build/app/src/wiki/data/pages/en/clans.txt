**Clans** are groups of players organized into teams. Every clan have //one// server, refereed as //Clan Server//.

====== Clan Power ======

So far, the only way to increase clan power is by attacking (DDoS'ing) other servers.

The amount of power earned by each attack depends of the DDoS power and who the victim is.

Victim multiplier:

    * Clan Server OR player with clan and on war against yours - x4
    * Player with clan, but not at war with yours - x3
    * Player without clan - x2
    * NPCs - x1

====== Clan Wars ======

===== Starting a Clan War =====

To start a clan war, one of the followings must happen:

    * Two (or more) members of clan A attacked one (or more) member of clan B and at least one member of clan B retaliated the attack in any member of clan A.
    * One member of clan A attacked two (or more) members of clan B and at least one member of clan B retaliated the attack in any member of clan A.

**Notes**:

    * Above mentions of clan member include the clan server.
    * Attacks older than 3 days are deleted, so the above conditions must happen in a window of 72 hours.

===== Finishing a Clan War ======

There is no way to manually end a clan war. 

Every clan war have an initial duration of 2 days (48 hours), and 1 hour is added to the duration after every following attacks.

===== Bounty & Score =====

Every clan war starts with empty score for both teams, //regardless of previous attack that started the war//. 

After every attack, an amount of bounty and score will be summed to the current values. This amount depends of how powerful the DDoS attack was.
