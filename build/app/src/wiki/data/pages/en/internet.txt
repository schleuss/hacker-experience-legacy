The Internet is the place where you can browse to different computers around the world. Servers can be owned by a real player, like you, or [[en:NPC|NPCs]].

====== Navigation ======
When logged out, the first thing you will see is the server's web content. It might display useful information if it's an [[en:NPC|NPC]], or it can be tailored content if the VPC is running the [[en:softwares#webserverexe|Webserver]] software.

On the upper-right corner of the web content, you can see which type of server you are connected to. Check the list of [[en:npc#npc_types|NPC types]].

If logged in, you'll have access to the victim's [[en:log|log file]] and [[en:softwares|softwares]]. These remote pages works pretty much the same way they do on localhost. 

====== Banks ======
When accessing banks, you might notice a different UI. You have the option to hack and login to the bank //server//, plus the option to hack and login a bank //account//.

When logged to a bank account, you can transfer it's money or change it's password (if you are the owner). Please note that **transferring money will generate logs on each account's bank**, i.e., if you are on bank A and will transfer to bank B, //both// banks will have your IP, the account numbers and the total amount transfered.
