**DDoS**, also refereed as DDoS attack, is the act of overloading someone's server by sending colossal amounts of data from dozens of different servers distributed through the Internet.

After the attack, the victim's hardware can be damaged. The severity of the damage depends directly of the DDoS Power.

====== Launching a DDoS attack ======

In order to launch a DDoS attack, you must have:
    * The target IP address listed on your Hacked Database.
    * At least three running DDoS Viruses, excluding any on the target IP.
    * A [[en:softwares#DDoS_breaker|DDoS Breaker]]
    * <del>The guts</del>

====== DDoS Power ======
The DDoS power is a number that rates how powerful the DDoS attack was.

The total DDoS power depends of:
   * each server's CPU
   * your current CPU
   * each server's installed ddos version

===== Increasing the power =====
Tips to increase the DDoS power:
    * Active the DDoS virus on more servers.
    * Use more powerful servers (servers with more CPU).
    * Make sure //you// have a powerful CPU.

As a general rule of thumb, a DDoS attack of 200 Gbps is considered a regular one. Meaningful attacks usually have 250 to 300 Gbps. 

====== Logs ======
Be aware that, when an attack is completed, logs will be recorded on every server that was part of the attack.
    * The launcher server:
        * <code>localhost launched a DDoS attack against [victim] [...]</code>
    * The victim server:
        * <code>[attacker] launched a DDoS attack against localhost [...]</code>
    * Every server with an installed ddos virus:
        * <code>[attacker] DDoSed [victim] via localhost [...]</code>
====== Mitigating a DDoS attack =======
A nice way to protect yourself from a DDoS attack is mitigating it. This feature is unlocked after you complete the [[en:university#DDoS_Security|DDoS Security]] certification.

If you have completed this certification, then your firewall will automatically mitigate the DDoS attack.

The level of mitigation will be based upon your firewall version and the DDoS power. In some cases, you can even nullify the attack.
